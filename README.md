# Project 1: Triple Peaks Library

The Triple Peaks Library webpage is the first project in the Software Engineering
program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a design brief. This peaceful library page uses semantic HTML and flat BEM for design structure and organized code.

Elements are positioned with Flexbox creating a cohesive layout with unique page sections and nav links according to their section. Reusable BEM blocks and nested structures are integrated, rendering large code blocks easy to identify, revise, and debug.
